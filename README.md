# ML-Algorithms

The project was part of my Masters program where I used various<br/>
ML Algorithms for prediction from various datasets.
 * **Linear Regression** for predicting House Prices.<br/>
 * **Logistic Regression** for prediction of student result.<br/>
 * **Navie Bayes** for Spam Filtering.<br/>
 * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for Irish Flower Dataset.<br/>
 * **Expectation Maximization (EM)** for Old Faithful Geyser Data.<br/>
 * **Neural Networks** for predicting a simple division function.<br/>
 * Tensorflow library was used to detect Keras dataset of numbers from (0 to 10).
